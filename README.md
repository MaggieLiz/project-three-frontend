Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe by Maggie Ward

Overview

This was my first project as part of the Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly. We were tasked with choosing a game from a curated list and building a version of that game. Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a twist on the classic children's game. Instead of game play in one 3x3 grid, you play in nine 3x3 grids with each turn determining the next player's grid options.

In the progress of the game, when player 2 places their butterfly token on the bottom-middle grid space it forces player 1 to now play in the bottom-middle grid.

When a grid is either won by a player or results in a draw, that grid is closed. The game ends when a player has won three grids in a line or there is an overall draw of the large grid.

Deployment

The game has been deployed with GitHub Pages and is available [here](https://maggieliz.github.io/sei-project-one/).

Brief

The challenge was to build a JavaScript grid game in one week. I was required to build a game that is playable for two players on the same device, taking turns to make their moves. I needed to display the winner when the game was over. Stretch goals were to make the game design responsive and have a single layer mode with the computer attempting reasonable moves.

Technologies Used

-   HTML5

-   CSS3

-   JavaScript

-   GitHub

Process

Planning

I began the planning stage with a wireframe for the page itself and by thinking through my strategy for building the game. I planned to first make a typical tic-tac-toe game that functioned as it ought with determining a win or draw. Then I planned to adapt that original game into a multi-game.

The Build

I used a for-loop to create the initial grid and its cells. I added turn-taking and then logic to check for a win or draw. Once this game was functioning as expected I expanded the for-loop to create nine grids with nine cells each. Now I needed to write controls to determine where a player could place their next token. Much of this logic was fairly repetitive and likely presents an opportunity to refactor.

I used CSS classes to force the game action. For example, depending on the cell played in a given grid the corresponding grid would receive an "open" class and the other grids would have a class of "closed." The "closed" class includes "pointer-events: none" to prevent players from trying to place a token in a closed grid.![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XJZVOAeG1kZq_FFQY4FfNhL-D69xAdMVmkmds_OWK5RCT5c05rmPk_Vp9p3ToFd0vOZIxy9UYhENGnZWTY0n32kx1WL5RAwnHogDud2e0n2bpQ4mI3vTqjj9v0qkexVUtqUy4JD7=s0)

I added logic to find win/draw conditions in each grid and in the game as a whole. This code was again very repetitive and probably is another opportunity for major refactoring.

This game easily lends itself to play on a smaller screen compared to many of the other grid-game options because it uses pointer events instead of arrow-key play. So, I made the game design responsive and it can be played on phones in addition to larger screen displays.

Known Bugs

When the game is over, due to a win or draw, the game grid has a "game-end" class applied to each grid that should prevent players from placing another token. This stopped working correctly after I resolved the problem of players clicking on a cell that already had a token.

I also was not able to get the local storage to hold more than one winner at a time.

Challenges

Implementing local storage was a struggle. I had a difficult time getting the information I wanted to print to the screen and ended up having to settle for only storing the most recent winner. I would like to be able to update local storage to return an array of winners.

There was a bug with a player attempting to place a token in a cell that was already occupied. I attempted unsuccessfully to solve this by applying classes to the occupied cells. I would work at it and then set it aside to work on other problems, returning to try and solve it again. Eventually, I asked for help and worked through it with a TA who helped me to find a solution. We settled on the final "} else {" shown below that returned a window alert to the player prompting them to choose an unoccupied cell.

A more general challenge I faced in this project was simply grappling with the size and organization. I was able to refactor to the point of cutting the lines of code in half, but it's still fairly unwieldy. I expect this will begin to feel more natural.

Wins

I am overall very proud of this first project. My time management was successful and I never felt too far behind. I enjoyed mapping out the steps logically and solving the problems that occurred.

Future Improvements

-   Correct the "game-end" bug described above.

-   Update Recent Winners local storage to reflect an array instead of only one object.

-   Add a computer player.

-   Add the ability to choose your own token.

-   Allow users to turn off sound effects.

-   Refactor repetitive code.

Key Learnings

Making this game for my first project was a fun and tangible way to demonstrate how much I learned in my first few weeks of class. I finished this project with a practical understanding of DOM manipulation and the JavaScript call stack.
